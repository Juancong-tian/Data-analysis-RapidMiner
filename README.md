# Data-analysis-RapidMiner

Task Description:
  This virtual case study was designed to investigate which characteristics of people are more likely to default on their loan repayments. In building a statistical model, 
  it is not only important to pre-treat outliers (filter out certain data types or parts of data types by certain rules), but ethics is also taken into account. The data 
  analysis report concludes with an analysis of the results based on the training model for the hypothetical party (i.e. the bank proposing the data analysis solution) and 
  suggests how to effectively avoid defaulting on loan repayments (how to effectively screen customers).
